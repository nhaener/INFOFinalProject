## Description

### What is the data?
Data set from: http://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/atlas/countydata/County_ListofIndicators.html
Stored in sub directory data
This data set is based on information from the CDC website on obesity rates by county in each state. This data set has obesity statistics from 2004 to 2012. 


### Who is the data for?
This data is for people who want to learn about obesity prevalence (prevalence by state and prevalence by sex by state). Also those people who want to see the relationship between obesity prevalence and diagnosed diabetes prevalence and leisure-time physical inactivity prevalence. 


### What do they want to learn?
The audience may want to compare obesity prevalence between sexes within a state or between two states. Three example questions may be:
- What is the obestiy prevalence of men in Washington state compared to obesity prevalence in women?
- How do the regions of America (west, midwest, south, etc.) compare in terms of obesity prevalence?
- How has obesity prevalence changed over the eight years represented in data?
